SyBoid
==============================

A complexity-based synthetic data generator based on the Boid algorithm. 

## System Requirements

### OS Requirements
The code development version has been test on Windows operating systems. The code is provided as a .ipynb and can be run on Google Colab and should in theory work on any operating system.

### Installation Guide
